# Kpop-Website-
I coded a kpop based website, which allows user to access information for their favourite kpop group and kpop idols. Right now I have coded the website using html, css and javascript to get used to it. I have learned and am in the process of implementing mysql to store user information. 

The first page lists all the kpop groups currently added. Once you click on anyone, you will see a brief description about the group at the top. Then the members will appear. The bts page allows users to click on each photo to access a pop up with their age , birthday and position. The mamamoo page allows you to like on the black boxes beside each members to access their info. After that comes the albums the groups have released and each page has a slide show gallery for each album. It also includes statistics such as spotify plays for each song and the global album sale pie chart. 

Eventually this will become a data and data science project. The website will with the help of api, be able to fetch albums sales, concert sales and other statistics from the internet in real time. It will also implement different games and chat features to allow kpop fans to interact with each other.
