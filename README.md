# Kpop-Website-
I coded a kpop based website, which allows user to access information for their favourite kpop group and kpop idols. Right now I have coded thr website suign html, css and javascript to get used to it. I have learned and am in the process of implementing mysql to store user information. 

Eventually this will become a data and data science project. The website will with the help of api, be able to fetch albums sales, concert sales and other statistics from the internet in real time. It will also implement different games and chat features to allow kpop fans to interact with each other.
